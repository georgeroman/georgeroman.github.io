        <p>Last two weeks were really busy for me as I had my final exams and also moved to a new place for the summer. But, fortunately, I’ve managed to get to an end with the <code>JSON</code> clone algorithm implementation and can return to working on improving and writing WebDriver commands.</p>
<p>Besides the previously existing support for returning primitive JavaScript types from <code>ExecuteScript</code> and <code>ExecuteAsyncScript</code>, I added support for returning <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-collection">collections</a>, <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-element">web elements</a>, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#windowproxy">window proxies</a> and objects having a <code>toJSON</code> function property, as per the WebDriver <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-json-clone">specification</a>. Currently, only <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/23725"><code>collections support</code></a> is pushed on the Servo’s GitHub repository in order to keep the changes easy for review, but I will progressively push the rest of the changes once the pending pull request is merged into the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p>Support for returning objects is still missing. I really wanted to have a full implementation of the <code>JSON</code> clone algorithm, but I decided that it’s better to focus on other things since supporting returning objects requires some additional work that would take a good amount of time. Anyway, I’ll keep this in mind and save the work I’ve done on it for some time in the near future.</p>
<p>As part of last weeks’ work, I also improved the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/d0bd2d5e44d4006b00ef53f351945d01e1c8458d/components/script/dom/bindings/conversions.rs#L556"><code>is_array_like</code></a> by providing support for the collection types needed by the <code>JSON</code> clone algorithm. The improvements can be found <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/23669">here</a>,</p>
<p>I can say that these last two weeks were the most challenging so far, but also the most rewarding. I’ve really enjoyed working on low-level <a href="https://doc.servo.org/mozjs/"><code>mozjs</code></a> stuff. It was an awesome learning experience and it definitely deepened my understanding of the interactions that occur within the browser’s backend.</p>
<p>This week I’m planning to investigate the failing tests issue in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/23585">this</a> pull request, return to working on missing WebDriver commands (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#get-element-property"><code>GetElementProperty</code></a> for example), add support for more <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#locator-strategies">locator strategies</a> for finding elements and, hopefully, get the changes from the last two weeks merged into the main branch.</p>
